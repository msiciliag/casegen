# CaseGen

A local tool for generating business challenges and practicing problem-solving.

### Concept

CaseGen is a minimalist, local application. Its sole function is to present a complex business problem, generated by an external model, for the user to analyze and propose a solution.

All challenges and responses are saved exclusively on the device. There are no servers, accounts, or tracking.

### Usage

1.  **Setup**: Enter your API Key for the generative model in the settings section. This only needs to be done once.
2.  **Generate Challenge**: Press the button to receive a new challenge.
3.  **Write Solution**: Develop your business model proposal in the text editor.
4.  **Save**: Store the case and your response in your local history to review it later.

### Single Requirement

The application requires an API Key from a generative model provider (e.g., Vertex AI) to generate challenges. The application is otherwise completely offline.

### Stack

Python, Flet, SQLite.
